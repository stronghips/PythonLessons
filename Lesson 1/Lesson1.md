## Source Control
### git Repositories

Get the repository from Github: `git clone https://github.com/stronghips/test.git`

Get remote changes from Github:
Open a terminal (in VS Code) or a command line and enter:
- `git pull` - Pull latest changes from github to local repo.
- `git fetch` - Synchronize local repo information with github.

Get local changes to Github:
1. Stage your changes (locally): `git stage .`
2. Commit your changes (locally): `git commit`
3. Write a commit message: What are the changes about?
4. Push changes to Github: `git push`

## Note on the command line
CLI (command line interface)
A command line is also called a terminal (e.g. in VS Code).

## Note on file systems, directories, paths
This `C:\Users\user\test` (Windows) is called a path, more exactly a directory path.

Important commands for handling files and directories:
- `dir`  - Show all files & directories in the current directory.
