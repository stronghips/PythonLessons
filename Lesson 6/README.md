## What are classes?
Classes are a way to define new data types.
Data + functions that operate on that data.

When we create an object of class, i.e. an instance of a class.
- "we instantiate the class to create an object".

Note:
- Methods & functions are the same thing.

### Constructor (special function)
When a class is instantiated, i.e. when an object is created,
the constructor is called automatically.

## One class per file rule
Don't put too much stuff into your files, they should be as short
as reasonably possible. So, because of that and because one class
is typically responsible for one thing, you shouldn't put more than
one class into a file.
