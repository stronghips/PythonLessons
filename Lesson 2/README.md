## Packages
Packages contain functions and other things that we can use in our
program. They have been written by someone and we can use the functionality
of those packages.

To use a package we have to install it using the package manager pip.
- `pip install turtle`
And then we have to import the functions that we need from the package in
our program:
- `from turtle import *`

## Control structures
## Conditional statements: if, else, elif

A condition is true or false.

## Loops

A loop has a body, that is all the code that is executed
in one loop iteration.

### while
We usually don't know how often the loop is executed.
How many loop iterations are executed.

A while loop has a condition and it will execute as long
as the condition is true.

### for
We know before we enter the loop how often it will
be executed.

It doesn't have a boolean condition, but it usually has a loop
counter or a loop variable.

## Operators
### Boolean Operators not, ==, !=, &&, ||
They evaluate to true or false.

### Comparison Operators <, >, >=
They evaluate to true or false.

### Arithmetic Operators +, -, *, /
The evaluate to a number.

## Note:
- A boolean condition is a condition like `2 == 3`, and it evaluates to true or false.
- `.md` files contain markdown language.
