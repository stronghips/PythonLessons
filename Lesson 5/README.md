## Data Structure
### Array
['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

## Branching, if conditions
### Locical Operators
- `or` operator: `True` if either of the operands is `True`
- `and` operator: `True` if both of the operands are `True`

## Software Development Principles
Clean Code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change for a human.

### A Function should do only one thing
If we have code that does not follow good software development principles, we can refactor it.
Refactoring means changing the code without changing the functionality of the code.

Rule: A function should not have more than 10 lines of code.

If it is longer, that is what we call a Code Smell.
